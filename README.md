# NeighbourhoodMessagePassingExperiments
Code and data supporting the paper 'Neighbourhood Message Passing Computation on a Lattice with cP systems - Part One' by Cooper &amp; Nicolescu (submitted to the Journal of Membrane Computing).  The code files are all in the 'Code' folder.  Files with data used in the paper's preparation, as produced by the 'nmp' C# program have been included in the file 'Data.zip'.  It has been zipped, since it is a collection of output text files, which taken together are actually quite large.  The data were parsed from those outputs and analysed separately.  To the best of our knowledge, you should be able to reproduce the results seen in the paper, if desired, from what is kept here.
