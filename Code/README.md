This folder contains the code files that were used to generate the data for the experiments in the paper, and the visualisation in the analysis section.

The file "AsyncNMP model validation.linq" is the one used to validate the ruleset, as per section 8.1.  It should be run using [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/).

The files "nmp.cs" and "nmp.csproj" make up the program that was used for the other sections of the experiments.  They were prepared using .NET 5.0.  They are used simply as normal command line programs.  Some sample input configuration files as used for the various experiments are provided, too, for reference.

The file "NMP Visualisations.linq" was used to produce the visualisations shown in section 7.4, and should also be run with LINQPad.
